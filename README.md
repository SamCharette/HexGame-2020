**Version One of Hex Game Platform for AI**

This is the first version of a game of hex with the intended function being the experimentation with various AI player algorithms.  This project is no longer actively developed.  Instead a new version is currently in the work.

I decided to open this project up to public visibility because, well, why not :)

**Board Drawing**

The code drawing of the board is a direct result of https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/14948/Hexagonal-grid-for-games-and-other-projects-Part-1 .  I don't recall how much code is copy and pasted regarding that, but no matter how much or little, that article deserves credit.

**"This looks ugly"**

Yep.  This was a project I put together to play around with AI.  The windows game portion was ancillary.
